Section 80TTA — Deduction in respect of interest on deposits in savings account
[IT Act 1961, as amended up to Finance Act 2025]

80TTA. (1) Where the gross total income of an assessee, being an individual or a Hindu undivided family—
(a) includes any income by way of interest on deposits (not being time deposits) in a savings account with—
    (i) a banking company to which the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 applies (including any bank or banking institution referred to in section 51 of that Act);
    (ii) a co-operative society engaged in carrying on the business of banking (including a co-operative land mortgage bank or a co-operative land development bank); or
    (iii) a Post Office as defined in clause (k) of section 2 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898;

there shall be allowed, in computing the total income of the assessee, a deduction of an amount equal to the whole of such income or ten thousand rupees, whichever is less.

CEILING: ₹10,000 per annum

Key definitions and scope:
"Deposits" include savings bank account deposits only. Time deposits (Fixed Deposits, Recurring Deposits) are EXCLUDED. Interest from FDs and RDs is fully taxable as Income from Other Sources.

"Savings accounts" covered: Regular savings bank accounts in scheduled commercial banks, co-operative banks, or Post Office savings accounts. This includes SB accounts under Post Office Savings Account Scheme.

What is NOT covered:
- Fixed Deposit (FD) interest — NOT covered by 80TTA
- Recurring Deposit (RD) interest — NOT covered by 80TTA
- Interest from loans given to friends, relatives — NOT covered
- Interest from corporate bonds, debentures, NSC — NOT covered
- PPF interest — exempt under Section 10(11), separately

Section 80TTB — For Senior Citizens (supersedes 80TTA):
Section 80TTB (inserted from AY2019-20) provides a HIGHER deduction to senior citizens (age 60 years or more). Under 80TTB:
- Deduction on interest from savings accounts, FDs, RDs, and any deposit with bank, cooperative bank or post office.
- Limit: ₹50,000 per annum (vs ₹10,000 under 80TTA)
- Senior citizens (60+) should claim 80TTB instead of 80TTA.
- 80TTA is NOT available to senior citizens who are eligible to claim 80TTB.

Interaction between 80TTA and 80TTB:
- If the assessee is BELOW 60 years: 80TTA applies (savings account interest only, up to ₹10,000)
- If the assessee is 60 YEARS or MORE: 80TTB applies (all interest including FD/RD, up to ₹50,000)
- A senior citizen cannot claim BOTH 80TTA and 80TTB simultaneously.

Availability under new tax regime (Section 115BAC):
Deduction under Section 80TTA is NOT available under the new tax regime. Section 80TTB (senior citizen interest deduction) is also NOT available under the new tax regime.

TDS on savings account interest:
TDS is NOT deducted on savings bank account interest (banks do not deduct TDS on SB interest). TDS is deducted only on interest from TD (FD/RD) exceeding ₹40,000 per year (₹50,000 for senior citizens). The assessesee must self-declare savings account interest in ITR-1 under "Income from Other Sources" and claim 80TTA deduction.

Example for ITR-1:
An individual (age 35) earned ₹9,500 as savings account interest from SBI and ₹4,200 from Post Office savings account. Total savings interest = ₹13,700.
- Enter ₹13,700 under "Income from Other Sources" in ITR-1.
- Claim ₹10,000 as 80TTA deduction (limited to ₹10,000 ceiling).
- Net taxable interest from savings = ₹3,700.

For a senior citizen (age 65) earning FD interest of ₹38,000 and savings account interest of ₹5,000 = total ₹43,000:
- Claim ₹43,000 under IFOS.
- 80TTB deduction: ₹43,000 (entire amount, since it is below ₹50,000 cap).
- Net taxable interest = NIL.
