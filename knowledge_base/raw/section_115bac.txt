Section 115BAC — Tax on income of individuals, Hindu undivided families, association of persons, body of individuals, and artificial juridical person
[IT Act 1961, as amended up to Finance Act 2025 — Budget 2025 Slabs effective AY2025-26]

OVERVIEW:
Section 115BAC introduces the "New Tax Regime" (also called the "Simplified Tax Regime" or "Concessional Tax Regime"). Budget 2025 (Union Budget for FY 2025-26) further modified the slab rates. The new regime is THE DEFAULT regime from AY2024-25 onwards — taxpayers must actively opt out to use the old (regular) regime.

115BAC(1A) — NEW TAX REGIME SLAB RATES for AY2025-26 (FY 2024-25):
[As amended by Finance Act 2024, applicable from Assessment Year 2025-26]

Slab (Total Income)                  | Tax Rate
--------------------------------------|----------
Up to ₹3,00,000                      | NIL
₹3,00,001 to ₹7,00,000               | 5%
₹7,00,001 to ₹10,00,000              | 10%
₹10,00,001 to ₹12,00,000             | 15%
₹12,00,001 to ₹15,00,000             | 20%
Above ₹15,00,000                      | 30%

Note: Basic exemption limit under new regime = ₹3,00,000 (vs ₹2,50,000 under old regime).

87A Rebate under new regime (AY2025-26): Individuals with total income up to ₹12,00,000 pay ZERO tax (full rebate under section 87A as amended).

Standard Deduction under new regime (AY2025-26): ₹75,000 (enhanced from ₹50,000 under old regime). This standard deduction is available to salaried employees and pensioners.

Effective zero-tax scenario: With ₹75,000 standard deduction and ₹12,00,000 rebate threshold:
Salary income up to ₹12,75,000 → After ₹75,000 SD → ₹12,00,000 taxable income → ZERO TAX (full rebate).

Surcharge under new regime (AY2025-26):
- Income > ₹50,00,000 but ≤ ₹1 crore: 10%
- Income > ₹1 crore but ≤ ₹2 crore: 15%
- Income > ₹2 crore but ≤ ₹5 crore: 25%
- Income > ₹5 crore: 25% (capped at 25% under new regime, as opposed to old regime's 37% for income above ₹5 crore)
Note: Maximum surcharge under new regime is 25%; maximum marginal rate is thus 39% (30% + 25% surcharge + 4% cess).

Health and Education Cess: 4% on (income tax + surcharge).

OLD TAX REGIME SLAB RATES for AY2025-26 (FY 2024-25):

Business income taxpayers (self-employed) can switch to old regime only once. Once they switch back to old regime, they cannot return to new regime except in one circumstance.

115BAC vs 115BAC(1A):
115BAC was originally introduced by Finance Act 2020 (AY2021-22 onwards). 115BAC(1A) was inserted by Finance Act 2023 (effective AY2024-25) to make the new regime the default and to introduce the modified slabs. Finance Act 2024 further enhanced: standard deduction from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000, employer NPS from 10% to 14%, and 87A rebate threshold from ₹7,00,000 to ₹12,00,000.

Income Level      | Old Regime Tax  | New Regime Tax  | Net Saving (New vs Old)
------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------
₹5,00,000         | NIL (87A)       | NIL (87A)       | Equal
₹7,00,000         | ₹52,000         | NIL (87A)       | New regime saves ₹52,000
₹10,00,000        | ₹1,12,500       | ₹54,600         | New regime saves ₹57,900
₹12,00,000        | ₹1,72,500       | NIL (87A)       | New regime saves ₹1,72,500

At higher income levels with significant deductions (80C: ₹1.5L, 80D: ₹50K, HRA: ₹1L+, 24(b): ₹2L), old regime may become more beneficial. The crossover point depends on individual deductions claimed.
