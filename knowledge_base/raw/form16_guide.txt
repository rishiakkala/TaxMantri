Form 16 — Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) Certificate for Salaried Employees
[Comprehensive Guide: Components, Reading, and Reconciliation with ITR-1]

WHAT IS FORM 16?
Form 16 is a certificate issued by an employer to an employee under Section 203 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. It certifies the amount of TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) deducted from the employee's salary and deposited with the Central Government on behalf of the employee. It also serves as a comprehensive income and deduction summary for the financial year.

Form 16 consists of TWO PARTS:
- Part A: TDS summary (certificates of tax deducted and deposited, generated from TRACES portal)
- Part B: Salary and deduction details (annexure prepared by employer)

FORM 16 — PART A:

Part A is generated by the employer from the TRACES (TDS Reconciliation Analysis and Correction Enabling System) portal. It contains:

1. Employer's TAN (Tax Deduction Account Number)
2. Employer's PAN
3. Employee's PAN
4. Employee's name and address
5. Assessment Year (e.g., 2025-26)
6. Period of employment (From Date to To Date — if employee changed jobs during the year, each employer issues a separate Form 16)
7. Summary of TDS deducted quarter-wise and deposited into the government account
8. Unique certificate number (generated by TRACES)

Part A is digitally signed and must be downloaded only from the TRACES portal to be considered authentic.

FORM 16 — PART B (SALARY DETAILS AND DEDUCTIONS):

Part B is prepared by the employer and annexed to Part A. It contains the detailed salary computation:

Section A — Gross Salary:
- Salary (Section 17(1)): Basic pay, DA, bonus, commission, other taxable salary elements
- Perquisites (Section 17(2)): Rent-free accommodation, car perquisites, ESOP perquisites, etc.
- Profits in lieu of salary (Section 17(3)): Joining bonus, notice pay, etc.
- Total Gross Salary = Sum of above

Section B — Allowances Exempt under Section 10:
- HRA exempt under Section 10(13A) read with Rule 2A
- LTA exempt under Section 10(5)
- Children education allowance under Section 10(14)(ii): ₹100 per month per child (max 2 children) = ₹1,200 per child per year
- Hostel allowance under Section 10(14)(ii): ₹300 per month per child (max 2 children) = ₹3,600 per child per year
- Transport allowance for physically disabled employees: ₹3,200 per month (for employees with disability)

- Total Exempt Allowances (to be deducted from Gross Salary)

Section C — Net Salary:

Section E — Income Chargeable under the Head "Salaries":
- = Net Salary MINUS Total Section 16 Deductions

Section F — Deductions under Chapter VI-A declared by employee:
The employee provides a declaration (typically in April) to the employer for TDS computation. Part B shows these:

HOW TO USE FORM 16 FOR ITR-1 FILING:

Step 1: Collect Form 16 Part A + Part B from each employer (if multiple employers during the year).

Step 2: Verify Gross Salary in Part B matches with salary credits in bank account and pay slips.

Step 3: Check Allowances Exempt (Section 10): Verify HRA exemption calculation using Rule 2A formula. If different from employer's computation, assessee may recompute and claim the correct amount in ITR.

Step 4: Verify Section 16 deductions (Standard Deduction, Professional Tax).

Step 5: Check if employer has considered all deductions declared (80C, 80D, etc.). If employee forgot to declare something (e.g., new LIC premium, additional donation), the assessee can still claim it directly in ITR-1 even if employer did not consider it in TDS computation — the excess TDS deducted will be refunded.

Step 6: Verify TDS amount in Part A matches the tax credit visible in Form 26AS and Annual Information Statement (AIS) on the Income Tax portal.

Step 7: If there are DISCREPANCIES between Form 16 and AIS/26AS: The amounts in 26AS are authoritative. If TDS deposited by employer is less than what is shown in Form 16, the shortfall remains the assessee's liability. Contact employer to rectify.

Step 8: Compute final tax liability in ITR-1 incorporating all income heads (salary, house property, other sources) and deductions.

COMMON ISSUES WITH FORM 16:
1. Multiple employers in the year: Each employer deducts TDS independently; the combination may result in under-deduction. Assessee must consolidate all Form 16s and pay any balance as self-assessment tax.
2. Previous employer did not issue Form 16: Employee can use salary slips, bank statements, and Form 26AS details to reconstruct income.
3. Employer error in calculating HRA or other exemptions: Assessee can self-compute and claim correct amount in ITR.
4. Incorrect professional tax amount: Verify with pay slips; the actual amount paid (not employer's estimated figure) is deductible.
5. 80C investments not submitted to employer before deadline: Now claim directly in ITR — they are not lost.

FORM 12B:
When an employee joins a new employer mid-year, they must submit Form 12B to the new employer declaring income and TDS from previous employer. This enables the new employer to deduct TDS on aggregate income. Failure to submit may result in lower TDS by the new employer and a self-assessment tax demand at the time of ITR filing.

FORM 16A:
Form 16A is a TDS certificate for non-salary income (FD interest, professional fees, rent, etc.). It is different from Form 16 (which is exclusively for salary). Both may need to be referenced while filing ITR.
