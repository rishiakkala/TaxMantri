2. SECTION 87A REBATE ENHANCED (New Regime):
[Section 87A as amended for new regime, effective AY2025-26]
- Old limit (AY2024-25): Income up to ₹7,00,000 → zero tax (rebate of tax payable)
- New limit (AY2025-26): Income up to ₹12,00,000 → zero tax (full rebate of income tax)
- Old regime 87A threshold remains unchanged at ₹5,00,000 (rebate ₹12,500)

Effective zero-tax income under new regime AY2025-26:
- With ₹75,000 standard deduction → salary gross income up to ₹12,75,000 = zero tax
- Without standard deduction (e.g., self-employed) → gross income up to ₹12,00,000 = zero tax

Marginal relief: Tax payable for income slightly above ₹12,00,000 shall not exceed the excess income over ₹12,00,000.

3. STANDARD DEDUCTION ENHANCED (New Regime):
[Section 16(ia) as inserted in Section 115BAC, effective AY2025-26]
- Old standard deduction (both regimes AY2024-25): ₹50,000
- New regime standard deduction AY2025-26: ₹75,000 (increased by ₹25,000)
- Old regime standard deduction AY2025-26: ₹50,000 (unchanged)
- Family pensioners (new regime AY2025-26): ₹25,000 standard deduction from pension income

4. EMPLOYER NPS CONTRIBUTION — LIMIT ENHANCED:
[Section 80CCD(2) as amended, effective AY2025-26]
- Old limit: 10% of basic + DA for private sector employers; 14% for Central Govt
- New limit AY2025-26: 14% of basic + DA for ALL employers (Central Govt, State Govt, private sector)
This deduction is available under BOTH old and new regimes.

5. SURCHARGE CAP UNDER NEW REGIME:
Maximum surcharge under new regime: 25% (for income above ₹2 crore)
Old regime surcharge: 25% for ₹2-5 crore; 37% for income above ₹5 crore
[The 37% surcharge is NOT applicable under the new regime — capped at 25%]
Maximum effective tax rate under new regime = 30% + 25% + 4% cess ≈ 39%

6. CHANGES TO CAPITAL GAINS TAXATION (AY2025-26):
[Finance Act 2024 — effective 23 July 2024 for new transfer scenarios]
- Short-term capital gains on listed equity / equity MF: Increased from 15% to 20% (for transfers on/after 23-07-2024)
- Long-term capital gains on listed equity / equity MF: Increased from 10% to 12.5% (for transfers on/after 23-07-2024)
- LTCG exemption threshold: ₹1,25,000 per year (increased from ₹1,00,000) for listed equity and equity-oriented MF
- Holding period: 12 months for listed securities, 24 months for unlisted shares and immovable property (for AY2025-26 — change from 36 months for immovable property effective 23-07-2024)
- Indexation benefit: Removed for properties purchased on or after 23-07-2024 for capital gains computation. Properties purchased before 23-07-2024 have the option to compute with or without indexation (whichever is beneficial as per CBDT clarification).

7. TDS THRESHOLD CHANGES (effective FY 2025-26 / AY2026-27 — informational):
Note: Some changes announced in Budget 2025 are effective from 01-04-2025:
- TDS threshold on interest (non-senior citizens) — FD interest via Section 194A: ₹50,000 (up from ₹40,000)
- TDS on senior citizen interest (Section 194A): ₹1,00,000 (up from ₹50,000)

8. NEW REGIME AS DEFAULT:
From AY2024-25 onwards (Finance Act 2023), the new regime is the DEFAULT. Taxpayers who want to continue with the old regime must explicitly opt out using Form 10-IEA or as per their employer's process. Salaried individuals may change their regime choice every year.

9. SECTION 80CCH — AGNIVEER CORPUS FUND:
Entire amount received from the Corpus of Agniveer at the time of exit/death is exempt. Deduction of employer's contribution to Agniveer Corpus Fund is available under both old and new regimes.

REGIME SELECTION BREAKEVEN (rough rule of thumb AY2025-26):
If total deductions (80C + 80D + HRA + 24(b) interest + others) under old regime > ₹3,75,000, then old regime may be more beneficial above ₹15 lakh income. Otherwise, new regime is generally beneficial.
